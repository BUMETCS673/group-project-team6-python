## Project Description:

Our project is making a team assign tool that can automatically assign students to a team, which involves the concepts of front-end, back-end, database and so on. We named it "iGroup". The main idea of the Team assignment tool is to help create teams based on students preferences and background. For this application, we choose Python as our development programming language, and use Django as framework. Algorithmically, we weight different preferences to create the most appropriate team.

#### Code Commit Guideline and Git Branching Strategy
During development, we each have our own branch of development. 
Also, we created some special branches for important features.

## Quality Assurance Management

### Coding Standard
Please refer to this link: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/
Our standards will be based on the contents in this link.

### Code Review Process
Team members review each other’s code. We will make sure we all review code that is not from ourselves. We will use pull requests for the code review, to make sure there is no conflict. Recently we don’t have a checklist that everyone must do, but we do require the reviewer to give feedback about cleanliness, clarity and bugs.

### 
Testing Plan
