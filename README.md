## Project Description:

Our project is making a team assignment tool that can automatically assign students to a team, which involves the concepts of front-end, back-end, database and so on. We named it "iGroup".  The main idea of the Team assignment tool is to help create teams based on students preferences and background. Algorithmically, we weight different preferences to create the most appropriate team.

## Configuration Management
#### Tools
Version Control: Git,Github
Front end (optional): VS Code(HTML,CSS)
Back end: intellJ(IDE)(Java),  framework(optional):Spring Boot,Maven
Database(optional):DataGrip(PostgreSQL relational database) :
CI/CD:TeamCity(optional)
(In this project, we will use Git and Github as the version control tools. Please also specify any other tools to be used, e.g. IDE tools, CI/CD tools, container tools, SAST or DAST tools, and any other DevOps tools)

#### Code Commit Guideline and Git Branching Strategy
GitHub-Flow
GitHub Flow is a very suitable Git Branching Strategy for a small team like us. It allows us to all develop together effectively. and the pull request will be reviewed by every team member, especially tech lead before merge.

#### Deployment Plan if applicable
Use Maven to pack our Spring Boot project to an executable jar file or in other ways.
